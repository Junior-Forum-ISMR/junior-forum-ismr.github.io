<h1 id="submission-details">submission details</h1>

<p>We invite researchers to submit their recent work on the development, analysis, or application of score-based methods. A submission should take the form of a short paper of <strong>4 pages in PDF</strong> format using the <strong><a href="https://score-based-methods-workshop.github.io/pmlr/Score_based_method_workshop_latex.zip">template</a></strong>. Additional pages containing references and appendices are allowed. For questions and troubleshooting of the template, visit CTAN.</p>

<p>The review process will be double-blind. Author names need to be anonymized and references/appendices may extend as far as needed beyond the <strong>4-page upper limit</strong>. Submissions may include a supplement/appendix, but reviewers are not responsible for reading any supplementary material.</p>

<p>All accepted submissions will be accompanied by a poster presentation. A number of selected papers will also be invited for a contributed oral presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Dual submission policy</strong>: If a paper has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including the NeurIPS 2022 conference), it should be extended in order to be accepted at our workshop. If a paper is currently under review (e.g. in AISTATS 2023 or ICLR 2023), it can still be submitted to this workshop.</p>

<p>The submission website is on <strong><a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/SBM">OpenReview</a></strong>. Camera-ready versions are due by <strong>Nov 25, 2022</strong>, and will be posted on the workshop website.</p>
