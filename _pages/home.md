description: A workshop to bring together researchers who use score-based methods in machine learning and statistics. 
---
The score function is the gradient of the log-density. As a unique way to represent probability distributions, score functions have enabled the development of many computationally efficient tools for machine learning and statistics, collectively known as score-based methods. By working with distributions through score functions, they have found widespread applications in vastly disjointed subfields of machine learning and statistics.

The impact of score-based methods in each of these fields has been significant. For example, generative models based on score functions, known as score-based generative models or denoising diffusion models, allow the generation of very high quality and diverse data, emerging as the new state-of-the-art technique in applications such as text-to-image generation, video generation, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation. Developments on Stein’s method and score-based approaches for SDEs have also advanced fast and robust Bayesian posterior inference in high dimensions, with applications to improving simulation models in engineering fields.

Through this workshop, we aim to
* Bring together researchers from a wide range of subfields to initiate a broad discussion on what makes score-based methods so successful, and what common challenges are faced across seemingly different areas of research;
* Explore the potential of score-based methods to a wide range of relevant real-world applications, such as those in computer vision, signal processing, computational chemistry, and other disciplines of science and engineering. 

By doing so, we hope to facilitate synergy across score-based methods in different fields, identify unexplored areas that can benefit from insights into these methods, and provide the foundations for the development of a more coherent research community focused on tackling the challenges of score-based methods.

This workshop will be an **in-person event** at [NeurIPS 2022](https://neurips.cc/), taking place on **Dec 2nd 2022 (tentative)**. The session will cover invited talks, contributed talks and posters.
